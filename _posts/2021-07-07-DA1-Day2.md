    November 28, 2020
    
    Earlier this week the ITU issued a press release to publicise the move to the approval process - by the 193 member states of the Union - of their ITU-R Recommendation: 'Detailed specifications of the radio interfaces of IMT-2020.' (ITU-R M.[IMT-2020.SPECS]).
    
    The document - due for publication in February 2021 - will be the end product of a long process, initiated in 2012, under the banner 'IMT for 2020 and beyond' where the ITU set out its agenda for a steady progression of 5G research activities that would nourish the 3GPP efforts on the new radio and 5G core specification work.
    
    The ITU press release formally announces the radio interfaces that conform with the International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT-2020) performance requirements:
    
    "The technologies are: 3GPP 5G-SRIT and 3GPP 5G-RIT submitted by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and 5Gi submitted by Telecommunications Standards Development Society India (TSDSI). During the multi-year development and evaluation process by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), these technologies were deemed to be sufficiently detailed to enable worldwide compatibility of operation and equipment, including roaming."
    
    
    
    
    
    The following material is reproduced for your information, from our September 2020 Highlights (Issue 1) newsletter article, penned by our TSG RAN Chair and the group's convenor for the ITU-R processes:
    
    3GPP finalizes contribution for IMT-2020
    
    September 1, 2020
    
    By Giovanni Romano, TSG RAN ITU Ad-hoc group Convenor and Balazs Bertenyi, TSG RAN Chair.
    
    IMT stands for International Mobile Telecommunications, the term used by the ITU to describe families of radio interface standards for mobile systems, starting from IMT-2000 (3G). The latest member of the IMT family is IMT-2020 which calls for support for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and for new ‘use cases’ that require massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC).
    
    The alignment between the standards for 5G and the geo-political commitment to IMT-2020 is set to allow for a coordinated timeline for technology evolution in all markets and the possibility of a global approach to spectrum planning as well as equipment production.
    
    Since October 2014, 3GPP has been a leading participant in the ITU-R process to prepare the way for terrestrial radio interface specifications for IMT-2020. In June 2019, TSG RAN delivered a complete proposal including detailed self-evaluation documentation and a ‘Statement of compliance’ to the IMT-2020 requirements. A period of assessment then followed – by the fifteen ITU-R appointed Independent Evaluation Groups (IEGs) – up to February 2020, with no concerns being raised on the 3GPP submissions.
    
    The latest stage of the process – completed by June 2020 – has seen the final submission of the 3GPP set of specification material and the technology overview, to be included in the ITU-R M.[IMT-2020.SPECS] Recommendation entitled “Detailed specifications of the terrestrial radio interfaces of International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020)”.
    
    3GPPs IMT-2020 proposal
    
    The 3GPP “5G” final proposal includes two separate and independent submissions, defined as the single Radio Interface Technology (RIT) and the combined Sets of Radio Interface Technologies (SRIT):
    
    Submission 1: SRIT (RP-191524)
    
    Component RIT: NR
    
    Component RIT: E-UTRA/LTE (incl. standalone LTE, NB-IoT, eMTC, and LTE-NR DC)
    
    Submission 2: RIT (RP-191528)
    
    NR
    
    Each submission is self-contained and complete unto itself, consisting of Releases 15 & 16.
    
    The 3GPP submissions are each collectively supported by the seven 3GPP Organizational Partners (Standards bodies; ARIB, ATIS, CCSA, ETSI, TSDSI, TTA and TTC) following their approval of the following:
    
    An overview of the main radio characteristics (RP-191523).
    
    The Compliance Template, a self-assessment on the fulfilment of the IMT-2020 requirements.
    
    The Link Budget Template, providing useful information on cell radius and network planning.
    
    TR 37.910, providing an exhaustive analysis of 3GPP “5G”, including simulation assumptions and results performed in the self-assessment.
    
    3GPP aspects included in IMT-2020
    
    Based on both 3GPP Submissions, the 3GPP aspects to be included in IMT-2020, spanning Release 15 & 16, are organised as follows:
    
    - Overview of the radio interface technology – This Section describes the main radio characteristics. For the SRIT it describes both NR and LTE, including NB-IoT, eMTC and LTE-NR DC, while for the NR RIT focuses on the NR radio aspects.
    
    - Detailed specifications of the radio interface technology – This Section provides the list of the 3GPP specifications to be included as ‘Global Core Specifications’ and to be transposed by the 3GPP OPs as authorised Transposing Organizations. Per each specification, the title and a short synopsis is provided. The specifications are taken from:
    
    SRIT: series 36 (“LTE (Evolved UTRA), LTE-Advanced, LTE-Advanced Pro radio technology”), 37 (“Multiple radio access technology aspects”) and 38 (“Radio technology beyond LTE”)
    
    RIT: series 37 (“Multiple radio access technology aspects”) and 38 (“Radio technology beyond LTE”)
    
    Taking 5G to the core
    
    Although the focus of Recommendation ITU-R M.[IMT-2020.SPECS] is only on radio interfaces fulfilling IMT-2020 radio requirements - Information on backhauling, core network and service aspects is referenced in the 3GPP submissions, with a link to the 3GPP specifications web page provided, to give a complete system perspective.
    
    The importance of system and core network specifications cannot be overstressed, as they address the network, terminal, and service aspects required to provide an integrated mobility solution. In addition to the radio work submitted for IMT-2020, the broader 3GPP system includes aspects such as user services, connectivity, interoperability, mobility and roaming, security, codecs and media, operations and maintenance, charging.
    
    More to do
    
    The process for the finalization of Recommendation ITU-R M.[IMT-2020.SPECS] is now approaching its conclusion (Nov. 28: See story above). The 3GPP contribution to the document is paramount to its success and is a monument to the good co-operation between the ITU-R and 3GPP for more than two decades.
    
    In the future, following the ITU-R process, 3GPP will provide updates - containing details of new features specified in Release 17 and beyond - to be included in revisions of the Recommendation.
    
    Author’s footnote The completion of the submission was done thanks to the contribution of the 3GPP delegates and companies. Special thanks to: Wu Yong and Asbjörn Grövlen, Rapporteurs for the self-evaluation Study Item; Riikka Susitaival - main editor for the preparation of the final material for inclusion in M.[IMT-2020.SPECS], along with David Mazzarese, Francesco Pica, Meng Xi and many other colleagues – you know who you are!

    A Hong Kong court on Tuesday sentenced an American lawyer to four and a half months in prison for clashing with a plainclothes police officer during the 2019 pro-democracy protests in the city, a move that comes at a time when several foreign workers are considering leaving the financial hub following Beijing’s crackdown on all forms of dissent in the city.
    Riot police secure the area outside the Tung Chung MTR station on September 7, 2019 in Hong Kong, ... [+] China. 
    Samuel Bickett, a 37-year old former Bank of America Merrill Lynch employee, was charged with assaulting a police officer and was handed a jail term of four months and two weeks, Bloomberg reported.
    The judge who handed out the ruling described Bickett’s actions as a “serious threat to public order.”
    Bickett had been found guilty on the assault charge last month and was denied bail.
    The lawyer had pleaded not guilty last month and had accused the off-duty officer of needlessly brandishing his baton at him.
    The police officer in question, however, told the court that Bickett knelt on his chest and slapped him while he tried to snatch the baton.
    In a statement published after his sentencing, Bickett said the verdict was “outrageous” and was “entirely unsupportable by both the law and the evidence in this case.” Bickett planned to appeal the verdict and said he “not rest until justice is done.”
    The U.S. State Department has listed Hong Kong under a Level 3 Travel Advisory which dissuades Americans from traveling to the city. The advisory cites “arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-19-related travel restrictions.”
    Last week, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers wrote to President Joe Biden drawing his attention to China’s “ceaseless assault” on democracy in Hong Kong. The lawmakers have asked Biden to share what his administration was “doing to coordinate with allies and partners to ensure that the private sector” knows about the risk to U.S. citizens and interests in Hong Kong posed by the city’s national security law. In 2019, several Hong Kong residents organized mass protests across the city to oppose a law that would have allowed Hong Kong’s government to detain and extradite people to mainland China. Following the protests, Beijing moved to exert stronger control over Hong Kong and imposed a draconian national security law in June 2020 that gave sweeping powers to the city’s authorities to target political dissidents, and established secret police and a national security council to oversee its implementation.

#### 3. Import Credit_card_records.xml
- Create a dataframe containing the categories and the information in the XML
- Ensure that characters are left as strings and numerical data as integer/float
- NOTE: to do so, you need to know what types of categories are in the XML data. Open the file with a notepad or a texteditor



```python
import pandas as pd
import xml.etree.ElementTree as et
```


```python
xtree=et.parse("Credit_card_records.xml")
xroot=xtree.getroot()

df_cols=["Name","Address","CreditCard","PIN","CVV"]

for node in xroot:
    s_Name=node.find("Name").text if node is not None else None
    s_Address=node.find("Address").text if node is not None else None
    s_CreditCard=node.find("CreditCard").text if node is not None else None
    s_PIN=node.find("PIN").text if node is not None else None

### ○ From the Web
#### 1. Import https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Felis_silvestris_catus_lying_on_rice_straw.jpg and:
- Show the image itself
- Crop the image so that the cat fills the photo
- Resize the image such that the shape is halved (i.e. x by y image becomes x/2 by y/2 image)
- Repeat above for grayscale


```python
from skimage.io import imread
from skimage.transform import resize
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
```


```python
example_file =("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Felis_silvestris_catus_lying_on_rice_straw.jpg")
image = imread(example_file)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
```

```python
image_crop = image[500:3000,600:4000]
plt.imshow(image_crop)
plt.show()
```

```python
image_resize = resize(image, (1750, 2500), mode='symmetric')
plt.imshow(image_resize)
print("data type: %s, shape: %s" % (type(image_resize), image_resize.shape))

#### 2. Import https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration and:
- Take the first table “2019 rankings”
- Truncate “m” or “%”
- Make numerical data integer/float
- The values should be “converted” such that m or % is no longer necessary (i.e. 30% → 0.3; 2m → 2000000)

    토스뱅크, 거물급 사외이사 물색 나서
    
    이달 개발자 대거 채용·파격 대우 제시
    
    카뱅도 공격적 인력 확보로 몸집 키워
    
    임직원 1000명 돌파...IT가 40% 차지
    
    3강 구도로 개편되는 인터넷전문은행이 공격적으로 정보기술(IT) 전문인력 확보 전쟁을 시작했다. 그동안 상대적으로 보조 역할에만 그쳐 있던 IT 인력이 비대면 디지털 채널이 뜨면서 업무 핵심 그룹으로 떠올랐다. 몸값도 덩달아 치솟고 있다.
    
    
    
    9월 출범을 앞둔 토스뱅크는 디지털에 특화한 '거물급' 사외이사 영입을 위한 물밑작업에 들어갔다. 기술력을 앞세운 토스뱅크는 IT 이해도가 높은 사외이사를 물색하고 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 토스뱅크 관계자는 4일 “이달 열릴 주총에서 사외이사를 선임할 계획”이라면서 “빅샷 영입이 예상된다”고 말했다.
    
    
    
    이보다 앞서 토스뱅크는 기존 금융사에서 업무집행 책임자를 끌어오기도 했다. 지난달 양수지 전 에이비엘생명보험 준법감시인과 최승락 전 스탠다드차타드 싱가포르 글로벌 매니저가 업무집행 책임자로 선임됐다. 양 책임자는 준법감시인, 최 책임자는 금융소비자보호최고책임자(CCO) 업무를 각각 맡았다.
    
    
    
    이달에는 개발자를 대거 채용할 계획이다. 채용 분야는 기술 분야의 제품기획과 디자인, 엔지니어링, 보안·인프라, 코어뱅킹, 데이터 등이다. 직전 회사의 최대 1.5배에 이르는 연봉 등 파격적인 대우를 제시했다. 또 토스뱅크는 출범 전 입사자에게는 주식매수선택권(스톡옵션)과 이직에 따른 보너스(사이닝 보너스)도 제공할 방침이다.
    
    
    
    카카오뱅크도 공격적으로 전문인력 확보에 들어가면서 몸집을 키우고 있다. 카카오뱅크 임직원 수는 지난달 말 기준 1023명으로, 지난 2017년 7월 출범 당시 300여명에서 4년 만에 3배 넘게 증가했다. 전체 임직원 가운데 약 40%는 IT 전문인력이다. 카카오뱅크는 2018년부터 경력 개발자를 공개채용하고 있다. 성장 가능성과 수평문화에 힘입어 매년 많은 개발자가 몰리는 것으로 평가받고 있다. 카카오뱅크는 “3년 동안 500억원 규모 투자를 한다”면서 “우수인력을 확보하기 위해 IT 전문 인력의 다양한 직무 분야 인력을 꾸준히 채용할 것”이라고 밝혔다.
    
    
    
    
    
    카카오뱅크는 금융 당국뿐만 아니라 기존 금융권의 금융통을 사외이사로 들였다. 3월 진웅섭 전 금융감독원장, 오평섭 전 KB국민은행 부행장, 최수열 현 삼도회계법인 파트너 등을 새로 영입했다.기존 인터넷전문은행이 IT 인력 확보에 사활을 걸자 시중은행의 발등에도 불이 떨어졌다. 기존 은행 입장에서도 경쟁력 강화를 위해 IT 인력 확보가 생존과 직결된다는 위기의식 때문이다. 다만 기존 은행은 IT 인력의 대거 채용 및 관련 조직의 신설 등에 한계가 있다. 그 대신 외부 인력 영입에 적극 나섰다. 박기은 네이버클라우드 최고기술책임자(CTO)는 4월 KB국민은행에 합류, 테크기술본부 전무를 맡았다. 신한은행은 혁신 가속화를 위해 김혜주 전 KT 상무와 김준환 전 SK주식회사 C&C 상무를 '디지털 혁신단'을 이끌어 나갈 리더로 영입했다. 또 김민수 삼성SDS AI선행연구랩장을 데려와 신한은행 통합AI센터를 맡겼다. 삼성SDS 출신인 이상래 NH농협은행 부행장은 지난해 7월부터 은행에서 디지털 전환을 이끌고 있다. 하나은행의 경우 디지털리테일그룹 미래금융본부에 부행장직을 신설하고 이커머스 전문가인 김소정 전 딜리버리히어로 본부장을 선임했다.

    else:
        herourl = hero[i].find('a').get('href')
    
    soup2 = bs(ure.urlopen(herourl).read(),'html.parser')
    
    txt = ""
